# PRTG Map Studio – notes for Claude

A browser extension (Manifest V3) that builds and pushes PRTG map objects and dashboards.
Last updated at version 1.5.45.

The owner is not technical. Explain things in plain words and give step-by-step instructions
when they need to do something themselves.

## Where things live

- GitHub: `keeper1306/prtg-map-studio`. Work on the `connectors` branch, then fast-forward
  `main` to it with `git push origin connectors:main`. Never merge into an old local `main`.
- Repo on the VM: `C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\prtg-map-studio`.
- Extension folder the browser runs: `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\PRTG Map Studio\extension`.
  It is not a git repo. Normally `app.html`, `app.js`, `manifest.json` and the files in `js\`
  change there.
- The tool always runs as a chrome-extension page (`background.js` opens `app.html`, which is the
  only thing that loads the scripts). The comment at the top of `js/01-config.js` about being
  "loaded into a PRTG tab" is outdated.
- PRTG install folder (read only, for reference): `C:\Program Files (x86)\PRTG Network Monitor`
  (`webroot`, `themes`, `frontend`, `Custom Sensors`, `lookups`, ...).

## Splitting app.js (in progress)

`app.js` is being split into plain script files in `extension/js/`, one region per version,
loaded by `app.html` in the same order with `defer` (no modules, no build step). Each region is
moved without changing a character. The full plan (region map, order, checks) was agreed with the
owner; stages so far:

- Stage 1 (1.5.44): timer stopper + `config` → `js/01-config.js`. Done; the owner said to go on.
- Stage 2 (1.5.45): `tabs` → `js/02-tabs.js` (it starts with the blank line that followed
  config). Done; waiting for the owner's test.
- Still in `app.js`: link style, page, info, dashboard, push, library, objects, dashtabs, start.
- Next stages, in order: dashtabs + the last two lines (back,
  `10-dashtabs.js` + `11-start.js`), link style (`03-linkstyle.js`, add a `@region: linkstyle`
  marker), page (`04-page.js`), info (`05-info.js`), objects (`09-objects.js`), library
  (`08-library.js`), push (`07-push.js`), then what is left of `app.js` becomes `06-dashboard.js`.
  Only take a region from the front or the back of what is left, so the order never changes.
- Checks at every stage: (1) join the files in `app.html`'s order and compare with the previous
  `app.js`: only the new changelog entry may differ; (2) `tests/run-tests.js`; (3) the list of
  window names the page creates (102 at 1.5.43) and `CFG` must be unchanged.

## Rules

1. Don't guess. Check, or say "I have not verified this".
2. Ask for access instead of working around it.
3. Never type the owner's PRTG username, passhash or password.
4. After every change, update both GitHub and the VM extension folder:
   - Bump `"version"` in `extension/manifest.json`.
   - Add a changelog entry at the start of `CFG.changelog` in `extension/js/01-config.js`
     (it moved there from `app.js` at 1.5.44). It is one
     string, newest first, in the form `'1.5.41: What changed. 1.5.40: ...'`. Write apostrophes
     as `\u2019`, like the existing entries do. (`CFG.version` in the config says `1.4.2`, but
     line ~98 of `js/01-config.js` replaces it with the manifest's version at startup, so only the
     manifest needs bumping.)
   - Commit, push `connectors`, then push `connectors:main`. The owner wants this done directly,
     without pull requests or asking first. GitHub prints "Bypassed rule violations ... Changes
     must be made through a pull request" for `main`; that is expected.
   - Copy `manifest.json`, `app.html`, `app.js` (while it exists) and the `js` folder into the
     extension folder, and confirm every copy is byte-identical by hash. This does both and prints
     SAME or DIFFERENT for each file (every line must say SAME):
     ```powershell
     $src = "C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\prtg-map-studio\extension"
     $dst = "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\PRTG Map Studio\extension"
     New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$dst\js" | Out-Null
     Copy-Item "$src\manifest.json", "$src\app.html" $dst
     if (Test-Path "$src\app.js") { Copy-Item "$src\app.js" $dst }
     Copy-Item "$src\js\*.js" "$dst\js\"
     Get-ChildItem $src -Recurse -File -Include *.js, *.html, *.json | ForEach-Object {
       $rel = $_.FullName.Substring($src.Length)
       $a = (Get-FileHash $_.FullName).Hash
       $b = (Get-FileHash ($dst + $rel) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Hash
       "{0}  {1}" -f $(if ($a -eq $b) { 'SAME     ' } else { 'DIFFERENT' }), $rel
     }
     ```
     When the split is finished and `app.js` is gone from the repo, show the owner the old
     `app.js` in the VM folder and ask before deleting it.
5. Commit as keeper1306 (`keeper1306@users.noreply.github.com`). End every commit message with:
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` (use the model actually running).
   Add a `Claude-Session: <link>` line only when the session has a claude.ai/code link.
6. Measure cost, not only speed.
7. Report what wasn't verified on the real PRTG.
8. Never write to PRTG's install folder. It's read only.

Line endings: every text file in the repo is LF and there is no `.gitattributes`. Git on the VM
was installed with "Checkout as-is, commit as-is" (`core.autocrlf=false`). Keep it that way, or the
hashes against GitHub won't match.

## Tests

`tests/` has a stand-in PRTG server and automated push and Undo checks (see `tests/README.md`).
Run them after any change to push, Undo or storage code, and after each stage of splitting
`app.js`. They need Node.js, Python and Playwright's Chromium; they are not part of the extension.
Installed on the VM (2026-11-03, owner approved): Node.js 26.13.0 LTS and Python 3.15.2 (for all
users, on PATH), Playwright 1.63.0 in `tests\node_modules`, its Chromium in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright`. A shell opened before that install may need Node's folder
(`C:\Program Files\nodejs`) added to PATH. Ask before installing anything else.
A full run takes about 5 seconds (16 seconds the very first time).

## Known issues (not bugs to fix while doing other work)

- The sync record and push history are keyed by the exact server address. Connecting to the same
  PRTG through two addresses (for example the classic address and the new UI at `localhost:1616`)
  makes Map Studio treat them as two servers: Review shows already-pushed items as new, and Undo
  is not offered. Confirmed on the real PRTG at 1.5.43. Workaround: always use the same address.
  The owner chose to leave this until after `app.js` is split.

## Done recently (1.5.41 to 1.5.43)

- 1.5.41: Undo (push and map edits) only uses history recorded for the current server.
  History saved before 1.5.41 has no server and is not offered for Undo.
- 1.5.42: Replacing an item adds the new one first and deletes the old one after.
- 1.5.43: A push, Undo or map-edit record that can't be saved gives a red warning.
- Tested by the owner on the real PRTG and by `tests/run-tests.js`.

## Done earlier (1.5.37 to 1.5.40)

- Gauges on PRTG's own dial (PRTG classic, Neon glass, Flat minimalist, Cyber tech, Ambient glow,
  Clean) have three options:
  - Scale numbers: outside or inside, from the sensor's real min/max.
  - Value line: complete or up to the value.
  - Zone colours: PRTG's, or cyan `#01AEF0` / navy `#050F33` / pink `#E70062`.
- Glass & metallic was removed from the choices; objects already saved with it still draw.
- Face order: classic first, then the modern styles. The face pictures are on white.
- Defaults: Flat minimalist, Cyber tech and Clean start with the complete line and the scale
  inside. A new gauge starts as Flat minimalist on white.

## Not verified on the real PRTG

- The scale's numbers with live sensors.
- The Map designer stand-in dial.
- Whether the navy zone is readable on dark backgrounds.

## Brand .htm files (not in the repo; ask the owner for them)

- Already Tile kinds in the builder: Stat tile, String tile, Bar gauge, Interface tile,
  Channel chips, Channel chips (auto-fit).
- Ready but not in the builder: Radial gauge, Section backdrop, Text box, Weather widget.
  - Radial gauge: its maximum doubles when an error limit exists (90 becomes 200), and the
    value overlaps the ring.
  - Weather widget: defaults to Benjamin's widget and New York, and needs weatherwidget.org
    reachable.
- Not ready: both NetFlow panels, SNMP Trap and Syslog. They contain `YOUR_READONLY_USER` /
  `YOUR_READONLY_PASSWORD` placeholders, and the NetFlow ones need the toplist ID in HTML Before.
