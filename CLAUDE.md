# PRTG Map Studio – notes for Claude

A browser extension (Manifest V3) that builds and pushes PRTG map objects and dashboards.
State when this file was written: version 1.5.40, commit dc4f284.

The owner is not technical. Explain things in plain words and give step-by-step instructions
when they need to do something themselves.

## Where things live

- GitHub: `keeper1306/prtg-map-studio`. Work on the `connectors` branch, then fast-forward
  `main` to it with `git push origin connectors:main`. Never merge into an old local `main`.
- Repo on the VM: `C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\prtg-map-studio`.
- Extension folder the browser runs: `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\PRTG Map Studio\extension`.
  It is not a git repo. Normally only `app.js` and `manifest.json` change there.
- PRTG install folder (read only, for reference): `C:\Program Files (x86)\PRTG Network Monitor`
  (`webroot`, `themes`, `frontend`, `Custom Sensors`, `lookups`, ...).

## Rules

1. Don't guess. Check, or say "I have not verified this".
2. Ask for access instead of working around it.
3. Never type the owner's PRTG username, passhash or password.
4. After every change, update both GitHub and the VM extension folder:
   - Bump `"version"` in `extension/manifest.json`.
   - Add a changelog entry at the start of `CFG.changelog` in `extension/app.js`. It is one
     string, newest first, in the form `'1.5.41: What changed. 1.5.40: ...'`. Write apostrophes
     as `\u2019`, like the existing entries do. (`CFG.version` in `app.js` still says `1.4.2`;
     earlier sessions only bumped the manifest. Not verified whether anything reads it.)
   - Commit, push `connectors`, then push `connectors:main`.
   - Copy `app.js` and `manifest.json` into the extension folder.
   - Confirm the copies are byte-identical by hash, for example:
     `Get-FileHash extension\app.js, "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\PRTG Map Studio\extension\app.js"`
5. Commit as keeper1306 (`keeper1306@users.noreply.github.com`). End every commit message with:
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` (use the model actually running).
   Add a `Claude-Session: <link>` line only when the session has a claude.ai/code link.
6. Measure cost, not only speed.
7. Report what wasn't verified on the real PRTG.
8. Never write to PRTG's install folder. It's read only.

Line endings: every text file in the repo is LF and there is no `.gitattributes`. Git on the VM
was installed with "Checkout as-is, commit as-is" (`core.autocrlf=false`). Keep it that way, or the
hashes against GitHub won't match.

## Done recently (1.5.37 to 1.5.40)

- Gauges on PRTG's own dial (PRTG classic, Neon glass, Flat minimalist, Cyber tech, Ambient glow,
  Clean) have three options:
  - Scale numbers: outside or inside, from the sensor's real min/max.
  - Value line: complete or up to the value.
  - Zone colours: PRTG's, or cyan `#01AEF0` / navy `#050F33` / pink `#E70062`.
- Glass & metallic was removed from the choices; objects already saved with it still draw.
- Face order: classic first, then the modern styles. The face pictures are on white.
- Defaults: Flat minimalist, Cyber tech and Clean start with the complete line and the scale
  inside. A new gauge starts as Flat minimalist on white.

## Not verified on the real PRTG

- The scale's numbers with live sensors.
- The Map designer stand-in dial.
- Whether the navy zone is readable on dark backgrounds.

## Brand .htm files (not in the repo; ask the owner for them)

- Already Tile kinds in the builder: Stat tile, String tile, Bar gauge, Interface tile,
  Channel chips, Channel chips (auto-fit).
- Ready but not in the builder: Radial gauge, Section backdrop, Text box, Weather widget.
  - Radial gauge: its maximum doubles when an error limit exists (90 becomes 200), and the
    value overlaps the ring.
  - Weather widget: defaults to Benjamin's widget and New York, and needs weatherwidget.org
    reachable.
- Not ready: both NetFlow panels, SNMP Trap and Syslog. They contain `YOUR_READONLY_USER` /
  `YOUR_READONLY_PASSWORD` placeholders, and the NetFlow ones need the toplist ID in HTML Before.
